# calculate-distance

### Instruction:
Write a function in Python that prompts the user to provide 2 data points (x, y) and whether the user wants to get the Euclidean or Manhattan distance calculated from these two data points. If the user provides a non-numerical value for the data points, an error should be thrown stoping the function. You are not allowed to use any libraries. The output of that function should be the proper distance between these two data points. Let us consider only positive numerical values for this exercise

### Solution:
- Function prompts user to enter coordinates for the two points (x1, y1, x2, y2)
- Function prompts user to enter distance type. E for Euclidean or M for Manhattan
- The distance is then printed out
